# Bootcamp Portfolio

This is my portfolio site created for the projects made during my time at The Developer Academy's bootcamp. Each project page includes an overview of the final product along with images, and goes on to describe some difficulties and progression I had while coding the projet, and finally links to the project repo, and its frontend site / backend API where applicable.
