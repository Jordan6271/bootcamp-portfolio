There is a combat system which essentially uses\n'weakness items', by which I mean that most enemies have at\nleast one item which they are weak to, and if you are\nholding that item in your inventory when you choose to start\nthe fight with them, you will gain health, otherwise you\nwill lose health. The operative word there is 'choose' -\nthere is no fight that will begin just by entering a room,\nthe player has to specifically do an action to start each\nfight, so if they start a fight they're unprepared for it's\ntheir own fault, really.

After adding an item to the checklist, the checkbox can be checked to toggle it between completed states.',difficulty:"The main gripe in this project for me was redux. I largely had to rely on the set up in an example project and just repurpose that code for my project. I now understand a lot more than I did at the time of doing the project, though. I also had a bit of difficulty regarding the state management when toggling the checkbox - initially it was not properly linked with the ID of the specific item being toggled, and that confused me for a while.",progression:"Using redux in this project was a large point of progression for me, and although I still need to learn more around the usage of it, I understand it decently and how to set it up now. The ability to visually toggle between different pages but stay on the same actual url is also incredibly helpful and has been used in many of the upcoming projects.

It gave me some experience interacting with already made API\'s, and how to call on them correctly. I also decided to rewrite the majority of this project into functional components, making use of "useState" and "useEffect" from React. I chose to display the cards in a carousel using a package I found, and I added in the ability to change the location between three pre-determined places using the navigation menu.',difficulty:'The main difficulty I had with this project was when converting as much as possible over to functional components, and having to use "useEffect" instead of "componentDidMount". I was incredibly confused about the multiple versions of "useEffect" and when each of them would be called, so it took me a long time to figure out the right way to go about it. I do understand "useEffect" in far more depth now, though.',progression:"In contrast to the difficulties I had on this project - the same thing culminated in my most significant progression.

There is no frontend aspect, so the API has to be used via a specialised GUI, such as Insomnia or Postman. Essentially, this API is a book list, which allows users to add an item to the list with required fields of "title", "author", and "read" (read means \'read status\' and is of boolean type). It has all four CRUD operations; allowing a user to create, read, update, and delete entries, including retrieving objects from the list via specific IDs.',difficulty:'I had a bit of difficulty during this project with the correct payload information to call on to find a book using a specific ID in the url. I set up the url structure in the form of "/id=:id", so my error handling needed to be quite specific in order to report back helpful error messages. Overall though, I didn\'t find this project particularly difficult once I got over the hurdle of understanding how to properly interact with the results of the response to my requests.',progression:"This project helped me significantly improve both my knowledge of API and API calls, and more informative error handling. I also believe that launching the API on Heroku was a point of progression for me too, as there are relatively quite a lot of hoops to jump through to set a project up using it compared to Github Pages, and I feel it was a good sign that I managed to do this without much pain.

project was my first attempt at a real full-stack application. It includes a database and an API, along with a front end UI for a user to use, and all of this is tied together mainly through the use of Mongo. I enjoyed the concepts behind this project, and had fun setting everything up correctly. It is an events list app, where users can input an event along with some required associated information, and this is then saved in a database, and can then be viewed from the frontend UI, the API, or in the database itself. It contains all of the CRUD operations, and a user can only interact with the database via the API if they have a valid authorization token.",difficulty:"There were many challenges in this project, ranging from correctly setting up user authentication and passing the token through to the API client, to creating the databases and pushing data along to the necessary parts, to creating the forms used in the frontend in a way that all the information required in the database is properly shown to the user that it is in fact required. I also had some issues with error handling in the backend section, as I allowed the frontend error handling to be done mainly through the use of React forms, and had to specify errors relating to these manually in the API client. There was also slight difficulty in getting the frontend, hosted on Github Pages, and the API, hosted on Heroku, to both interact with the database, hosted on Mongo Atlas. However, all of these challenges were overcome by the end of the project.",progression:"I progressed in many aspects of my coding knowledge during this project. Outside of the specific scope of coding, I learnt a lot regarding database management and API tooling. In terms of coding, however, I figured out how to pass authentication tokens through the data in order to allow the user to see different results on their respective UIs (frontend or API). I also managed to ramp up my use of error handling in the API, allowing for more specific messages to be received by the user than my previous projects were capable of. This was the first project where I had a functional login page, and also the first project where I had the different parts of the project hosted in different repositories (although these have been moved into one mega-repo for ease of linking to from this portfolio). I am incredibly pleased with how this project turned out functionally, and would like to do more in terms of making the frontend UI look nicer than it does stylistically, and also add a 'Register' form so that users can create new accounts and see the events data linked to their own accounts.",links:{ghPages:"https://jordan6271.github.io/bootcamp-project-week14-frontend/#/",repo:"https://github.com/Jordan6271/bootcamp-project-week14-frontend",heroku:"https://bootcamp-week14-eventful.herokuapp.com/"}},ee={BasicWebPage:U,HobbyWebsite:F,JavaScriptQuiz:D,OOPAdventureGame:J,CaesarCipher:R,Calculator:W,Noteable:z,WhatToDo:M,WeatherWatch:L,BookListAPI:_,Eventful:function(){return Object(h.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[Object(h.jsx)("h1",{children:"Eventful"}),Object(h.jsx)(K,{fullStack:!0,carouselImages:$.images,introText:$.intro,difficultyText:$.difficulty,progressionText:$.progression,links:$.links})]})},NotFound:function(){return Object(h.jsx)(i.Fragment,{children:"404 - Sorry, this page was not found"})}},te=function(){return Object(h.jsx)(i.Fragment,{children:Object(h.jsxs)(r.c,{children:[Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week1",component:ee.BasicWebPage}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week2",component:ee.HobbyWebsite}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week4",component:ee.JavaScriptQuiz}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week5",component:ee.OOPAdventureGame}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week7",component:ee.CaesarCipher}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week9",component:ee.Calculator}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week10",component:ee.Noteable}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week11",component:ee.WhatToDo}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week12",component:ee.WeatherWatch}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week13",component:ee.BookListAPI}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/week14",component:ee.Eventful}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{component:ee.NotFound})]})})},Ae=(A(63),A(64),function(){return Object(h.jsx)("div",{className:"portfolio",children:Object(h.jsx)(s.a,{children:Object(h.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[Object(h.jsx)(p,{}),Object(h.jsx)(r.c,{children:Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"w-75 justify-content-center m-auto row text-light text-center pt-4",children:[Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:b,basename:"/bootcamp-portfolio"}),Object(h.jsx)(r.a,{component:te,basename:"/bootcamp-portfolio"})]})})]})})})});n.a.render(Object(h.jsx)(o.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(h.jsx)(Ae,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[65,1,2]]]);
