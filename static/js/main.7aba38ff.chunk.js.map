After university I had a\r\nnon-technical entry-level job, and spent a lot of my spare\r\ntime trying to make websites and simple video games (along\r\nwith playing lots of video games, which has given me a large\r\namount of passion to eventually make a 'proper' game that\r\nI'd enjoy sitting down and playing for as long as I have\r\nsunk into some others).`,\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst portfolioInfo = {\r\n    title: `About This Portfolio`,\r\n    info: `I've decided the best way for me to lay this portfolio out\r\n    is likely to be giving each project its own individual page,\r\n    and describing there how I tackled each task and screenshots\r\n    of what I ended up with, along with any hurdles I\r\n    encountered on the journey and how they were overcome.

The operative word there is 'choose' -\r\nthere is no fight that will begin just by entering a room,\r\nthe player has to specifically do an action to start each\r\nfight, so if they start a fight they're unprepared for it's\r\ntheir own fault, really.

Probably the\r\nchallenge that took me the longest to solve, though, was\r\ncreating the list of inventory items, but eventually I\r\nfigured out a way to make it work using a simple \"if\" statement, and pushing\r\nto an inventory array appended to the \"Player\" class.`;\r\n\r\nconst progressionText = `Every hurdle I eventually got over was a significant measure\r\nof progression for me on this project. I learnt how to use\r\nclasses in JavaScript and attach functions to them, how to\r\nuse arrays to save states of rooms and keep track of what\r\nthe player has done in the game so far, how to update text\r\nthat was displayed on-screen to the player (specifically\r\ncurrent health and the inventory list), how to create\r\ncommands that would do certain functions (for instance\r\nmoving between rooms or picking up items) and display\r\nrelevant error messages if incorrect inputs were entered,\r\nand also how to make sure that if the players' health\r\nreaches 0 then the game ends. I'm happy with the progression\r\nI had over the course of this project as a whole, I can't\r\nreally pick any one thing to highlight here - I'm just proud\r\nof how it all came together and created a functional game. I\r\nhave plans to take the concept behind this game and try and\r\ncreate a 2D game with the idea to get a start with C++.`;\r\n\r\nconst links = {\r\n    ghPages: `https://jordan6271.github.io/bootcamp-project-week5/`,\r\n    repo: `https://github.com/Jordan6271/bootcamp-project-week5`,\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst pageData = {\r\n    images: images,\r\n    intro: introText,\r\n    difficulty: difficultyText,\r\n    progression: progressionText,\r\n    links: links,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default pageData;\r\n","import Intro from \"./intro.png\";\r\nimport StartGame from \"./start-game.png\";\r\nimport ItemPickup from \"./item-pickup.png\";\r\nimport HealthIncrease from \"./health-increase.png\";\r\nimport EasyFight from \"./easy-fight.png\";\r\nimport HardFight from \"./hard-fight.png\";\r\nimport Death from \"./death.png\";\r\nimport WinGame from \"./win-game.png\";\r\n\r\nconst Week5 = [\r\n    { id: 1, image: Intro, description: `Game Intro Screen` },\r\n    { id: 2, image: StartGame, description: `Game Start` },\r\n    { id: 3, image: ItemPickup, description: `Item Pickup` },\r\n    { id: 4, image: HealthIncrease, description: `Health Increase` },\r\n    { id: 5, image: EasyFight, description: `Fight Win Easy Mode` },\r\n    { id: 6, image: HardFight, description: `Fight Win Hard Mode` },\r\n    { id: 7, image: Death, description: `Death Screen` },\r\n    { id: 8, image: WinGame, description: `Win Screen` },\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default Week5;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/intro.934be270.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/start-game.e6a98edf.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/item-pickup.170a33bd.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/health-increase.7423fdb3.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/easy-fight.1083c074.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/hard-fight.77ba15bb.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/death.63bfa29c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/win-game.4571c39c.png\";","import React, { Fragment } from \"react\";\r\nimport PageData from \"../data/OOPAdventureGame\";\r\nimport PageSections from \"../components/PageSections/PageSections\";\r\n\r\nconst OOPAdventureGame = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Fragment>\r\n            <h1>OOP Adventure Game</h1>\r\n            <PageSections\r\n                carouselImages={PageData.images}\r\n                introText={PageData.intro}\r\n                difficultyText={PageData.difficulty}\r\n                progressionText={PageData.progression}\r\n                links={PageData.links}\r\n            />\r\n        </Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default OOPAdventureGame;\r\n","import Images from \"../images/week7/Images\";\r\n\r\nconst images = Images;\r\n\r\nconst introText = `This project was to create a Caesar Cipher, which is\r\nessentially a form of substitution cipher that shifts\r\nthrough the alphabet in accordance with the numerical key\r\ngiven, so if you put a key of 1, each letter in the code\r\nwould shift one character to the right. I made my cipher\r\nshift through the ascii alphabet from '!' (ascii value 33)\r\nall the way to '~' (ascii value 126). I added the\r\nfunctionality to decrypt the given code as well and encrypt,\r\nwhich just runs the same function but in reverse, so it\r\niterates backwards through the appropriate range of ascii\r\nvalues. I also decided to use as minimal handwritten CSS as\r\npossible, and did as much of the styling as I could through\r\npure bootstrap.

As I\r\nattempted to style every component with bootstrap rather\r\nthan handwritten CSS, this project also gave me a chance to\r\nget much more familiar with bootstrap components, especially\r\nhow spacing can be done with the framework.
